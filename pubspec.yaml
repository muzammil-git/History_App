  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,      # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
      - family: Regular
        fonts:
            - asset: assets/fonts/bolt-regular.ttf
      - family: Bold
        fonts:
            - asset: assets/fonts/bolt-semibold.ttf

      - family: Quote
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Courgette-Regular.ttf

      - family: StyleQuote
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/DancingScript-Bold.ttf


  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
